# simple-rpg
An rpg made in golang using the pixel library

improvement ideas:
* sound volume should be adjustable in the config file
* support of multiple levels instead of a single level
* should the player be included in the entity package since it shares so many properties already? it could be like the spawner,
    a superset of entity 
* a cool ui for the player
